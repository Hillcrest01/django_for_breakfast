### Registering the Polls App in the Admin Panel

By default, your `polls` app and its models will not appear in the admin panel until you register them.

To register the `Questions` model:

1. Open the file `polls/admin.py`.

2. Add the following code:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from .models import Questions

   admin.site.register(Questions)
   ```

Now, when you visit the admin panel, youâ€™ll see the `Questions` model listed and can perform full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on its data.
